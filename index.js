// Working with Obejcts and Loops!!!


//âœ… Goal 1: Loop through the following array and calculate the total score.
//âœ… Follow Up: Print your result to the console using string interpolation for clarity.
// const games = [
//   { name: "Game 1", score: 5 },
//   { name: "Game 2", score: 8 },
//   { name: "Game 3", score: 2 },
//   { name: "Game 4", score: 10 }
// ];

//âœ… Goal 2: Create another loop that only calculates total of scores greater than 5
//âœ… Follow Up: Print your result to the console using string interpolation for clarity.




// âœ… Goal 3: Find the game with the highest score.
//âœ… Follow Up: Print your result to the console using string interpolation for clarity.


// ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Bonus: Print out EACH game that scored above 'average'


// âœ… Goal 1: Loop through the array and calculate the total score

// Goal 2: Calculate the total of scores greater than 5

// Loop through all games to compare scores
